==================

http://lessmilk.com/ created some simple games using a framework (Phaser). Cutting out Phaser and adding back in just enough code to make the games work is fun and instructive.

Similarly, I "demade" Flxteroids by Adam Atomic (that is, I mangled it, destroying most of the fun). Adam Atomic is the author of Flixel, the framework that inspired Phaser.
